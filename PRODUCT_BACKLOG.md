## Product Backlog üöÄ

### 0. Modular Architecture Refactor (Current Iteration) - IN PROGRESS

Goal: Transition from monolithic synthesizer hook to a modular, patchable architecture modeling real-world subtractive synthesis components with CV / Gate semantics.

Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Core type system for Modules, Ports, Connections (AUDIO / CV / GATE / TRIGGER)
- [x] Base module factories: VCO, VCF, ADSR, SequencerTrigger, MasterOut (functional implementations)
- [x] Patch management hook (`usePatch`) supporting create / connect / disconnect / remove
- [x] 1V/Oct pitch standard with frequency conversion utilities
- [x] Updated UI instantiates modular components with drag & drop, pan/zoom workspace
- [x] Default module configuration with pre-wired connections
- [x] Backwards compatibility layer (legacy `useSynthesizer` still functional until migration complete)
- [x] Documentation updated to explain module API and CV / Gate conventions

Recent Progress (UI & Interaction):

- [x] Patch workspace with pan/zoom, grid with snap, and background panning
- [x] Precise port center alignment (runtime measurement with world-space offsets)
- [x] Click-to-click cable connection with live pending path
- [x] Port eligibility highlighting based on signal-type rules (AUDIO‚ÜîAUDIO, CV‚Üínon-AUDIO, GATE/TRIGGER interop)
- [x] Cable deletion by clicking cable or a hover ‚Äú√ó‚Äù handle near the midpoint
- [x] Cable colors by signal type (AUDIO, CV, GATE, TRIGGER)
- [x] Restored module draggability while keeping cables clickable (pointer-events layering)
- [x] Audio graph disconnection when a cable is removed (targeted disconnect of node/param)
- [x] VCO controls (waveform, pitch, detune, gain) with sliders + validated text inputs; values apply live via module.updateParams
- [x] VCO pitch CV input control: pitch slider disabled when CV connected, manual updates blocked via isPitchCVConnected flag
- [x] VCO gate control: free-running mode (gain=1) vs gate-controlled mode (gain=0, gate signal controls amplitude)
- [x] Interactive AHDSR envelope (Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release) with SVG editor, draggable & keyboard-accessible handles
- [x] Hold stage added + total time display + sustain % vs dB toggle
- [x] Zero-length stage support (A/H/D/R can be 0ms) & default Hold 20ms

- [x] Handle hover/focus highlight styling for clarity
- [x] Parameter smoothing helper added (linear / exp / setTarget) to de-zipper UI param changes
- [x] Sequencer module with transport controls, BPM, gate length, swing, and loop controls
- [x] Piano roll editor for step programming with note grid and octave selection
- [x] Master Out module with waveform visualizer (oscilloscope) showing real-time audio output

Stretch:

Technical Notes:

- **Pitch CV Standard**: Changed from 1V/Oct voltage to direct frequency in Hz for simplicity. Sequencer outputs frequency via `midiNoteToFrequency(note)` using formula `440 √ó 2^((note - 69) / 12)`. VCO accepts frequency directly on `oscillatorNode.frequency` AudioParam.
- **No built-in attenuverters** in core modules: signal conditioning handled by a Utility CV Module (mult / attenuator / attenuverter / inverter / offset / scale).
- **Gate Signal Architecture**: ConstantSource ‚Üí GainNode pattern. ConstantSource provides signal (offset=1), GainNode acts as on/off switch (gain switches 0/1). This allows gate timing via `setValueAtTime()` on the GainNode's gain parameter.
- **Gate Control in VCO**: VCO uses `vcaGainNode` for amplitude control. Free-running mode: `gain.value = 1`. Gate-controlled mode: `gain.value = 0`, external gate signal adds to this base value to control amplitude.
- **Pitch CV Control in VCO**: When pitch CV is connected, VCO sets `isPitchCVConnected = true` and blocks manual frequency updates in `updateParams()`. UI disables pitch slider when connection detected via `patch.connections` check.
- **Velocity CV**: Delivered as separate CV (0..1) for amplitude & modulation scaling.
- **Envelopes**: Output CV via an AudioParam (gain) initially; may expose ConstantSourceNode in future for patch flexibility.
- **Parameter Smoothing**: Smoothing utility wraps abrupt changes to prevent zipper noise (linear / exp / setTarget modes).
- **VCO parameter ranges**: Pitch 10‚Äì20,000 Hz, Detune ¬±1200 cents, Gain 0‚Äì1. Waveforms limited to built-in OscillatorNode types.
- **Polyphony** (future): voice allocator manages per-voice module sets (oscillators, amp env, filter optional). Voice count configurable up to a cap.
