## Product Backlog üöÄ

### 0. Modular Architecture Refactor (Current Iteration) - IN PROGRESS

Goal: Transition from monolithic synthesizer hook to a modular, patchable architecture modeling real-world subtractive synthesis components with CV / Gate semantics.

Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Core type system for Modules, Ports, Connections (AUDIO / CV / GATE / TRIGGER)
- [x] Base module factories: VCO, VCF, ADSR (initial functional implementations)
- [x] Patch management hook (`usePatch`) supporting create / connect / remove
- [x] 1V/Oct helper utilities (volts ‚Üî frequency)
- [x] Updated UI (experimental) instantiates 3 VCOs, 1 VCF, 1 ADSR and routes: VCO mix -> VCF -> destination; ADSR -> VCF cutoff (envelope as CV AudioNode); auto gateOn demo
- [x] Backwards compatibility layer (legacy `useSynthesizer` still functional until migration complete)
- [ ] Documentation updated to explain module API and CV / Gate conventions (IN PROGRESS)

Recent Progress (UI & Interaction):

- [x] Patch workspace with pan/zoom, grid with snap, and background panning
- [x] Precise port center alignment (runtime measurement with world-space offsets)
- [x] Click-to-click cable connection with live pending path
- [x] Port eligibility highlighting based on signal-type rules (AUDIO‚ÜîAUDIO, CV‚Üínon-AUDIO, GATE/TRIGGER interop)
- [x] Cable deletion by clicking cable or a hover ‚Äú√ó‚Äù handle near the midpoint
- [x] Cable colors by signal type (AUDIO, CV, GATE, TRIGGER)
- [x] Restored module draggability while keeping cables clickable (pointer-events layering)
- [x] Audio graph disconnection when a cable is removed (targeted disconnect of node/param)

Stretch:

- [ ] Visual patch inspector (list of modules + connections)
- [ ] Detachable / reorderable signal chain
- [ ] Cable style UI (drag to connect)

Technical Notes:

- Pitch CV Standard: 1V/Oct (A4 = 440Hz @ 4.75V reference). Centralized constants mean a future change affects only conversion helpers + stored patch interpretation.
- No built-in attenuverters in core modules: signal conditioning handled by a Utility CV Module (mult / attenuator / attenuverter / inverter / offset / scale).
- Gate events call `gateOn` / `gateOff`; Velocity delivered as separate CV (0..1) for amplitude & modulation scaling.
- Envelopes output CV via an AudioParam (gain) initially; may expose ConstantSourceNode in future for patch flexibility.
- Performance: begin with straightforward automation ramps (control-rate); smoothing utility will wrap abrupt changes to prevent zipper noise.
- Polyphony: voice allocator manages per-voice module sets (oscillators, amp env, filter optional). Voice count configurable up to a cap.
- ADR-001 (Pitch CV Standard) DRAFT recorded; low migration risk.
