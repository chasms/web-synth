## Product Backlog 🚀

### 0. Modular Architecture Refactor (Current Iteration) - IN PROGRESS

Goal: Transition from monolithic synthesizer hook to a modular, patchable architecture modeling real-world subtractive synthesis components with CV / Gate semantics.

Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Base module factories: VCO, VCF, ADSR, SequencerTrigger, MasterOut (functional implementations)
- [x] Patch management hook (`usePatch`) supporting create / connect / disconnect / remove
- [x] 1V/Oct pitch standard with frequency conversion utilities
- [x] Updated UI instantiates modular components with drag & drop, pan/zoom workspace

Recent Progress (UI & Interaction):

- [x] Patch workspace with pan/zoom, grid with snap, and background panning
- [x] Precise port center alignment (runtime measurement with world-space offsets)
- [x] Click-to-click cable connection with live pending path
- [x] Port eligibility highlighting based on signal-type rules (AUDIO↔AUDIO, CV→non-AUDIO, GATE/TRIGGER interop)
- [x] Cable deletion by clicking cable or a hover "×" handle near the midpoint
- [x] Cable colors by signal type (AUDIO, CV, GATE, TRIGGER)
- [x] Restored module draggability while keeping cables clickable (pointer-events layering)
- [x] Audio graph disconnection when a cable is removed (targeted disconnect of node/param)
- [x] VCO controls (waveform, pitch, detune, gain) with sliders + validated text inputs; values apply live via module.updateParams
- [x] VCO pitch CV input control: pitch slider disabled when CV connected, manual updates blocked via isPitchCVConnected flag
- [x] VCO gate control: free-running mode (gain=1) vs gate-controlled mode (gain=0, gate signal controls amplitude)
- [x] VCO pitch CV base frequency management: set to 0 when CV connected, restored when disconnected (fixes frequency addition bug)
- [x] Interactive AHDSR envelope (Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release) with SVG editor, draggable & keyboard-accessible handles

Stretch:

- [ ] Visual patch inspector (list of modules + connections)
- [ ] Detachable / reorderable signal chain
- [ ] Cable style UI (drag to connect)

Technical Notes:

- **Pitch CV Standard**: Changed from 1V/Oct voltage to direct frequency in Hz for simplicity. Sequencer outputs frequency via `midiNoteToFrequency(note)` using formula `440 × 2^((note - 69) / 12)`. VCO accepts frequency directly on `oscillatorNode.frequency` AudioParam.
- **No built-in attenuverters** in core modules: signal conditioning handled by a Utility CV Module (mult / attenuator / attenuverter / inverter / offset / scale).
- **Gate Signal Architecture**: ConstantSource → GainNode pattern. ConstantSource provides signal (offset=1), GainNode acts as on/off switch (gain switches 0/1). This allows gate timing via `setValueAtTime()` on the GainNode's gain parameter.
- **Gate Control in VCO**: VCO uses `vcaGainNode` for amplitude control. Free-running mode: `gain.value = 1`. Gate-controlled mode: `gain.value = 0`, external gate signal adds to this base value to control amplitude.
- **Pitch CV Control in VCO**: When pitch CV is connected, VCO sets `isPitchCVConnected = true` and blocks manual frequency updates in `updateParams()`. UI disables pitch slider when connection detected via `patch.connections` check. **CRITICAL**: VCO sets `oscillatorNode.frequency.value = 0` when pitch CV connects to prevent frequency addition (Web Audio adds connected signals to AudioParam's base value). Manual frequency restored when CV disconnected.
- **Velocity CV**: Delivered as separate CV (0..1) for amplitude & modulation scaling.
- **Envelopes**: Output CV via an AudioParam (gain) initially; may expose ConstantSourceNode in future for patch flexibility.
- **Parameter Smoothing**: Smoothing utility wraps abrupt changes to prevent zipper noise (linear / exp / setTarget modes).
- **VCO parameter ranges**: Pitch 10–20,000 Hz, Detune ±1200 cents, Gain 0–1. Waveforms limited to built-in OscillatorNode types.
- **Polyphony** (future): voice allocator manages per-voice module sets (oscillators, amp env, filter optional). Voice count configurable up to a cap.

Validated Test Cases:

1. **VCO Free-Running Audio**:
   - ✅ Add VCO → MASTER OUT, start audio → waveform visible, audio audible
   - ✅ VCO shows "Free Running" status indicator

2. **Piano Roll Octave Display**:
   - ✅ Octave selector set to 4 → Piano roll displays C4-B4 (MIDI 60-71)
   - ✅ Note calculation: `baseNote = (octave + 1) * 12` correctly maps octave selector to MIDI notes

3. **Sequencer Gate Signal Generation**:
   - ✅ Load defaults → press play → audio triggers with each step
   - ✅ Gate signal uses ConstantSource(1V) → GainNode(gain 0/1) architecture
   - ✅ VCO switches from free-running to gate-controlled when gate connected
   - ✅ MASTER OUT waveform displays animated audio visualization

4. **Sequencer Pitch CV Control**:
   - ✅ Sequencer plays C major scale (C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5) with distinct pitches
   - ✅ Each step changes frequency using `midiNoteToFrequency()` conversion
   - ✅ Pitch CV connected directly to `oscillatorNode.frequency` parameter
   - ✅ No same-note bug (each step has audibly different pitch)

5. **VCO Pitch CV Input Control**:
   - ✅ When pitch CV connected → pitch slider disabled in UI (grayed out)
   - ✅ Manual pitch slider changes blocked in VCO module (`isPitchCVConnected` flag check)
   - ✅ Only CV signal controls frequency when connected
   - ✅ When CV disconnected → pitch slider re-enabled and functional

6. **Sequencer Transport & Timing**:
   - ✅ Play button starts sequencer, changes to pause button
   - ✅ Step counter advances (1/8 → 2/8 → ... → 8/8 → 1/8)
   - ✅ Loop mode causes sequence to repeat continuously
   - ✅ BPM control changes tempo (tested 60-200 BPM range)
   - ✅ Gate length control affects note duration (10-100%)
   - ✅ Swing control creates rhythmic variation (0-100%)

7. **ADSR Envelope Modulation**:
   - ✅ Sequencer gate triggers ADSR envelope
   - ✅ ADSR Env CV modulates VCF cutoff frequency
   - ✅ Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release stages audibly affect timbre
   - ✅ Envelope amount control scales modulation depth

8. **Audio Chain Integration**:
   - ✅ Full chain: SEQUENCER → VCO → VCF → MASTER OUT produces filtered audio
   - ✅ All connections visible with correct cable colors (GATE=green, CV=orange, AUDIO=blue)
   - ✅ No audio clicks or pops during parameter changes
   - ✅ No console errors during playback
   - ✅ Clean disposal when modules removed

9. **MIDI Input Integration**:
   - ✅ MIDI In module detects connected devices (MidiKeys shown in device selector)
   - ✅ MIDI keyboard input produces audible sound: MIDI IN → VCO → MASTER OUT
   - ✅ Correct pitch frequencies: MIDI note 60 = 261.63 Hz (C4), note 69 = 440 Hz (A4)
   - ✅ MIDI Gate → VCO Gate: VCO switches to "GATE CONTROLLED" mode
   - ✅ MIDI Pitch CV → VCO Pitch CV: pitch slider disabled, frequency controlled by MIDI
   - ✅ VCO base frequency set to 0 when CV connected (no frequency addition artifacts)
   - ✅ Different MIDI notes produce correct pitch changes (verified C3-C5 range)
   - ✅ Gate timing: notes start on key press, stop on key release
   - ✅ Last-note priority: holding multiple keys switches to most recent note
   - ✅ Waveform visible on Master Out during MIDI playback
   - ✅ No stuck notes or console errors during MIDI input
   - ✅ Transpose control shifts pitches correctly (±24 semitones)
   - ✅ Velocity curves (Linear/Exponential/Logarithmic) affect velocity CV output

10. **Trigger Module Architecture Consistency**:

- ✅ Sequencer and MIDI In use identical signal generation patterns
- ✅ Both output frequency in Hz using same formula: `440 × 2^((note - 69) / 12)`
- ✅ Both use ConstantSource → GainNode for gate signals
- ✅ Both work interchangeably with VCO pitch CV and gate inputs
- ✅ VCO correctly handles pitch CV from either source (base frequency = 0 when connected)
